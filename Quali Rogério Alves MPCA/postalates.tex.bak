\begin{abstract}
As observed in the PhilSci preprint ID Code~1255~[1], consistency in the
author's proposed non-Aristotelian finitary logic~(NAFL) demands that
Euclid's fifth postulate must necessarily be provable from the first four,
and that diagrammatic reasoning with Euclidean concepts must necessarily be
admitted into the rules of inference for plane neutral geometry in order
to argue for the said provability. Two important consequences, namely,
the indispensable role of diagrams as formal objects of Euclidean
geometry in NAFL and the resulting NAFL concept of `line' as an infinite
proper class of line segments are highlighted and elaborated upon.
A misleading comment in Remark~6 of [1], regarding negation for
undecidable propositions in the theory of special relativity~(SR), is
corrected. This comment is unrelated to the main argument in [1] and
the resulting analysis reinforces the conclusions of [1] that negation
and implication are problematic concepts for undecidable propositions in SR.

\section{The essential role of diagrammatic reasoning in NAFL and the
resulting concept of `line' as an infinite proper class in Euclid's geometry}
Consider plane neutral geometry~(NG) as formalised in classical
first-order predicate logic~(FOPL). Our goal in this section is
to highlight and further elaborate upon two important results deduced
in~\cite{srneg}, namely, the \emph{essential} role of diagrams as formal
geometric objects in the non-Aristotelian finitary logic~(NAFL) proposed
by the author~\cite{nafl, nafl2} and the consequent NAFL concept of
`line' as an infinite proper class of line segments. In contrast, classical
logic admits a line as a mathematical object and considers diagrams to
be informal (and sometimes unreliable) reasoning tools.

An excellent reference for the formalization of diagrammatic reasoning
is the work of Miller~\cite{miller}. The modern attitude
towards diagrams is neatly summarized by the following quote
from Chapter~1 of~\cite{miller}:
\begin{quote}
It has often been asserted that proofs like this, which make crucial
use of diagrams, are inherently informal. The comments made by Henry
Forder in \emph{The Foundations of Geometry} are typical: `Theoretically,
figures are unnecessary; actually they are needed as a prop to human
infirmity. Their sole function is to help the reader to follow the
reasoning; in the reasoning itself they must play no part.' \dots
The transition from mathematics with geometry at its core to
mathematics with arithmetic at its core had a profound influence
on the way in which people viewed geometric diagrams. When geometric
diagrams were seen as the foundation of mathematics, the geometric
diagrams used in these proofs had an important role to play. Once
geometry had come to be seen as an extension of arithmetic, however,
geometric diagrams could be viewed as merely being a way of trying to
visualize underlying sets of real numbers. It was in this context
that it became possible to view diagrams as being ``theoretically
unnecessary'' and mere ``props to human infirmity''.
\end{quote}
Miller~\cite{miller} proceeds to develop the thesis that diagrams can
indeed be considered as formal objects in plane Euclidean geometry and
that diagrammatic proofs are as rigorous as their sentential counterparts.
NAFL takes this a step further: diagrams are \emph{necessarily} formal
objects and diagrammatic reasoning must \emph{necessarily} be admitted
into the rules of inference of classical NG in order to argue for the
provability, required by consistency in NAFL, of Euclid's fifth postulate
from the first four; see Sec.~2 of~\cite{srneg}.

The theory NG(NAFL) is the NAFL version of NG with diagrammatic reasoning
(admitting only Euclidean concepts) introduced formally into the rules of
inference. For an idea of how this can be done, see~\cite{miller}.
In order to argue for the provability of the fifth postulate
in NG(NAFL), `parallel' was re-defined in~\cite{srneg} as follows:
\begin{definition}\label{df1}
Two distinct coplanar lines are parallel if and only if they are
equidistant at all points, where distance between the lines at a
point (on either line) is defined as the length of the
perpendicular to the other line dropped from that point.
Similarly, a line segment AB that does not lie on a line $l$ is
parallel to $l$ if and only if AB is equidistant from $l$ at
every point of AB.
\end{definition}
It was stated in \cite{srneg} that Definition~\ref{df1} is first due
to Posidonius in the first century B.C.; however, it appears that
Archimedes~(287--212~B.C.) in his treatise \emph{On parallel lines}
had already defined parallelism similarly. Definition~\ref{df1} can
be extended in an obvious manner to define parallelism between two
coplanar line segments and we assume that this has been done.
Proposition~\ref{pr1} of \cite{srneg} is stated below for
convenience:
\begin{proposition}\label{pr1}
Given a line $l$ and a point \emph{P} at an arbitrary non-zero distance
$D$ from $l$, there exists a unique line segment \emph{M}
through \emph{P} parallel to $l$, such that \emph{P} is
at the midpoint of \emph{M} and \emph{M} is of a given arbitrary non-zero
length $L$. Here $D$ and $L$ are (standard) finite lengths.
The line segment \emph{M} will remain parallel to
$l$ when extended by an arbitrary (standard) finite length
such that \emph{P} continues to remain at the midpoint of M.
Here `parallel' is defined in Definition~\ref{df1}.
\end{proposition}
A diagrammatic proof of Proposition~\ref{pr1} was given in~\cite{srneg},
with a scaling argument to represent line segments~M of arbitrary length
in a single diagram drawn to scale; different line segments will imply
different scale factors for the diagram. Here we emphasize that Tarski's
axioms for NG do not permit the consideration of `arbitrary' entities, such
as, line segments; if NG is suitably modified to permit this, it becomes
classically incomplete, since NG would then interpret classical Peano
Arithmetic~\cite{simpson}. NAFL, however, rejects G\"odel's incompleteness
theorems~\cite{nafl2} and so NG(NAFL) can admit arbitrary line segments
without becoming incomplete~(equivalently in NAFL, inconsistent). In fact
consistency \emph{demands} that NG(NAFL) interpret Peano Arithmetic,
for the notion of `arbitrary' line segment is essential in the above
diagrammatic proof.

The rationale for the diagrammatic proof is that NAFL permits only
constructive Euclidean concepts, and the diagram represents precisely
the constructions we must have in mind when we think of `line' or
`line segment'. The scaling argument is simply justified by noting
that the ideal `lengths' of line segments in NG(NAFL) have nothing to do
with the \emph{physical} length of the line segment drawn in the
diagram; we are completely free to attribute an arbitrary scale factor
to represent arbitrary \emph{ideal} lengths, which are \emph{mental}
constructions, by a single \emph{physical} diagram. Let `\emph{idlg}'
represent the unit ideal length of a line segment in NG(NAFL), and let the
(usual, real-world) `inch' be the corresponding unit length in the diagram.
One might take the scale factor for the line segment~M of
Proposition~\ref{pr1} in the diagram as ``one inch = one
hundred~\emph{idlgs}''; one could also take the scale factor as,
for example, ``one inch = one hundred thousand~\emph{idlgs}'', etc.
It should be emphasized that these two scale factors correspond to two
\emph{different} line segments~M in NG(NAFL), represented in a
single diagram. The point here is that there is no reality for the
question of how many \emph{idlgs} are `actually' contained in one
inch, since NAFL does not require our mental constructions of line
segments and their unit length scale \emph{idlg} to have any connection
whatsoever with the real world; formally, this question is undecidable
in NG(NAFL), and the Main Postulate for NAFL~\cite{nafl,nafl2} makes
truth for such a proposition purely \emph{axiomatic} in nature. It follows
that in the absence of any axiomatic declaration as to the value of the
length $L$ (in \emph{idlgs}) of the line segment $M$ represented in the
diagram, \emph{all} ideal length scales are present in one inch in a
superposed state, as required by NAFL. It is this fact that
permits the scaling argument in NAFL, and the consequent representation of
arbitrarily long (mentally constructed) line segments superposed in a single
(physical) diagram. In fact this scaling argument is absolutely essential for
consistency of NG(NAFL), as will be argued shortly. In contrast, FOPL
requires that the line segment~M in the diagram represents one and only one
instance of Proposition~\ref{pr1}, which prevents the diagram from being a
direct proof of Proposition~\ref{pr1} and amounts to a Platonic assertion
that the line segments of NG `really' exist. Clearly, FOPL requires that
there is a fact of the matter as to the conversion factor between the ideal
length scale~\emph{idlg} and the physical length scale of one inch in the
diagram, despite the undecidability of this proposition in NG; different
conversion factors only succeed in redefining \emph{idlg} in terms
of inches from the FOPL point of view, and we are looking at one and only
one line segment~M of a fixed length. Of course,
similar diagrammatic proofs can be given in NG(NAFL) for each of the other
four postulates of Euclid which must also be asserted as tautologously
true in NG(NAFL). The fifth postulate was perceived to be
`counter-intuitive' precisely because FOPL does not permit such a
diagrammatic proof, as will be explained below.

Playfair's postulate, logically equivalent to Euclid's fifth
postulate~$\psi$, asserts that for every line $l$ and for every
point P that does not lie on $l$, there exists a unique line $m$
through P that is parallel to $l$. We use Playfair's postulate
interchangeably with $\psi$. It was argued in \cite{srneg} that
Proposition~\ref{pr1} provides a \emph{direct, constructive} proof of
$\psi$ in NG(NAFL). An indirect proof of $\psi$ may also be obtained
in NG(NAFL) by dropping perpendiculars from the end-points of the line
segment~M to the line $l$ of Proposition~\ref{pr1} and exhibiting
diagrammatically the rectangle bounded by $M$, $l$ and the two
perpendiculars. Since only Euclidean concepts are permitted in
diagrammatic proofs, the existence of such a rectangle is equivalent to
and proves $\psi$ in NG(NAFL). It was noted in \cite{srneg} that such a
diagrammatic proof is not legitimate in classical NG, because
FOPL requires that even infinitely many instances of
Proposition~\ref{pr1} (with Euclidean concepts) do \emph{not} prove
$\psi$ in NG; none of these instances represent the line $m$, which has
infinite length and is a separate mathematical object in classical logic.
Thus we have the classical anomaly that infinitely many instances
of Proposition~\ref{pr1} should not prove $\psi$ in NG, but if
the diagrammatic proof (with Euclidean concepts) is permitted, $\psi$
can be inferred \emph{indirectly} from a single such instance.
It was concluded in~\cite{srneg} that consistency in FOPL
necessarily requires the uninterpreted entities of NG to have
a non-constructive existence, and consequently, $\psi$ must
necessarily be undecidable in NG with non-Euclidean concepts permitted.
The above classical scenario is diametrically opposite
to the notion of consistency in NG(NAFL), as noted in \cite{srneg}.

The first observation is that the scaling argument in the diagrammatic
proof of Proposition~\ref{pr1} in NG(NAFL) neatly removes the
classical anomaly noted above; a single instance of Proposition~\ref{pr1},
as represented in the diagram, can be \emph{interpreted} via the
scaling argument to represent infinitely many instances and hence
provides a direct as well as indirect proof (via the rectangle
construction noted above) of Proposition~\ref{pr1}. Hence it is
absolutely essential to incorporate the scaling argument into the
rules of inference of NG(NAFL). Once this is done, we might as well
rename the resulting theory as EG(NAFL), where `EG' stands for Euclidean
geometry; all the axioms of classical EG are theorems of EG(NAFL),
provable by diagrammatic constructions. Here we have in mind a
finitely axiomatizable version of EG proposed by Tarski~\cite{simpson},
all of whose theorems are provable by elementary ruler and compass
constructions. EG(NAFL) has only diagrammatic rules of inference and no
axioms. It follows that diagrams of EG(NAFL) are formal objects that come
prior to and are more fundamental than the axioms of Tarski's elementary EG.
Indeed, since all of the theorems of EG are provable by ruler and
compass constructions, it is obvious that the axioms of EG must also be
so provable. It is striking that diagrammatic reasoning, which plays a
crucial and indispensable role in preventing inconsistency in EG(NAFL),
would be considered as `inconsistent' and `unreliable' in classical
neutral geometry. Note that the diagrams are  physical (real-world)
devices by which we communicate our mental geometric constructions
as `proofs' of the Euclidean postulates to our fellow-human beings.
As shown in Sec.~2 of \cite{srneg}, we can only have these Euclidean
constructions in mind; the classical non-Euclidean models neccessarily
have to assume the metamathematical (Platonic) truth of the Euclidean
postulates and so are not models at all by the NAFL truth definition.
If there were only one human being in the whole world, such an
individual need not construct any diagrams as formal devices to
prove the Euclidean postulates; the mental constructions would
suffice for this purpose.

The second observation is that the line segment~M of
Proposition~\ref{pr1} is of \emph{arbitrary} length~$L$, which is to be
interpreted in NAFL as being in a superposed state of (quantification
over) all possible \emph{standard} values for $L$. As
noted in \cite{srneg}, this amounts to an explicit construction
for the line $m$ because there are no nonstandard models for
arithmetic (and hence, for EG) in NAFL. Thus the line~$m$
of Proposition~\ref{pr1} is modelled as the union
of an infinite proper class of line segments~M, as represented
by the superposed state. Here we wish to make a few remarks on the
notion of infinite class, which is a \emph{proper class} and not a
mathematical object in NAFL~\cite{nafl}.

In NAFL, whenever infinitely many mathematical objects identified by
a given property (such as, that of being a natural number) exist within
a theory, that theory must also necessarily admit the corresponding
infinite class of such objects. The class comprehension scheme
is necessarily a theorem of NAFL theories which admit infinitely many
objects in the universe of discourse; quantification is
restricted to be only over objects that belong to classes.
NAFL interprets the axiom of extensionality for classes
(which is also necessarily a theorem of such NAFL theories) to mean
that an infinite class must be identified by \emph{all}
and \emph{only} its elements; the infinite proper class is by
itself not a mathematical object. The existence and uniqueness
of an infinite class can be inferred from, and is equivalent to,
the existence and uniqueness of every element of that class.
In the example of Proposition~\ref{pr1},
EG(NAFL) requires it to be universally quantified over all possible
lengths $L$; that there are infinitely many such line segments~M of
arbitrarily large lengths results from Euclid's second postulate,
which is a theorem of EG(NAFL). It immediately follows in NAFL that
an infinite proper class of such line segments, identified
constructively by a given property, exists; call this class $C$.
The assertion that $m$ is parallel to $l$ is to be
interpreted in NAFL as meaning that every line segment of the infinite
class $C$ is parallel to every line segment of the corresponding
infinite class constituting $l$. The `existence' and `uniqueness' of
the line $m$ is to be identified with, and may be inferred from,
the existence and uniqueness of every element of $C$.

At this stage the reader might wonder \emph{why} NAFL requires
quantification to be restricted to classes when infinitely
many objects are involved. This has been formally established
in~\cite{nafl2}; here we will give an intuitive explanation as follows.
Let us take the example of a line segment
of initial length $L_0$, and successively extended (equally on both
sides of the segment) to lengths $2L_0$, $3L_0$, $4L_0$, etc.
NAFL asserts that the process of extending the line segment may be said
to have been `completed', or equivalently, reached an `arbitrary'
length $nL_0$, if and only if the infinite proper class
$C=\{L_0, 2L_0, 3L_0, \dots, nL_0, (n+1)L_0, \dots,\}$ exists.
This infinite class represents \emph{all} extensions of the original
line segment \emph{at the same time}. If $C$ did not
exist, one can only imagine the line segment being extended, say, one
instance (in general, at most finitely many instances) at a time, but
by induction, such a process can never ever be `completed' and it would be
wrong to quantify over `all' such extensions. Equivalently, one can never
exhaust the class $N$ of natural numbers by counting them one at a time;
induction says that there will always be infinitely many natural numbers
left to be counted. Therefore quantification over infinitely many natural
numbers automatically implies the existence of $N$ in NAFL~\cite{nafl2}.
However, $N$ is a paradoxical entity because \emph{any} element of $N$ is
clearly accessible by counting one at a time. It is clear that `any'
in the preceding sentence does not translate to `all', for then the above
induction (that $N$ cannot be exhausted by counting one at a time) would be
violated. This is the intuitive explanation for why $N$ must be a proper
class in NAFL; for the formal argument that results from the axiomatic
nature of NAFL truth, see Sec.~3 of ~\cite{nafl}. To summarize,
for the purposes of quantification over infinitely many mathematical
objects, NAFL requires that $N$ must necessarily exist as a `completed'
infinite class, but the `incomplete' or `potential' nature of $N$ is
recognized by not admitting it as a mathematical object~(i.e., a set)
in NAFL theories. Thus NAFL provides the correct logical framework for
assertions denying the existence of a `completed' infinity by a
long list of famous logicians/mathematicians/philosophers, including
